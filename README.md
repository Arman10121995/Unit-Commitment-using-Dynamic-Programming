# Unit-Commitment-using-Dynamic-Programming
We performed Unit commitment which is the most economical and cost-efficient way for power generation.  • Considers power consumption at different times and different constraints of the power plants • Predicts sequence of enabling and disabling the generating units intelligently • Minimize the cost of generating units • Reduces the amount of fuel consumption and hence is more eco-friendly • Increase the efficiency of the entire process  all of the above was performed using a dynamic programming algorithm which is  • Conventional algorithm process for optimization • Divide into multiple steps or stages • Use recursive solution procedure
